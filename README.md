# Data Science Project - Machine Learning

This repository contains machine learning projects that I developed as part of my university course **Data Science Applied to Electrical Energy Systems** at **Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya**. The goal of this course was to explore various machine learning algorithms and techniques using popular frameworks such as **Scikit-Learn**, **Keras**, and **TensorFlow**.

## Projects Overview

1. **Project 1: [Predicting Electricity Price for Tomorrow]**

## Acknowledgements and References

The following resources were instrumental in developing my understanding and the implementation of machine learning algorithms:

- **Book**:
  - GÃ©ron, A. (2019). *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems*. O'Reilly Media.
  
- **Course Materials**:
  - This project was developed as part of the course **Data Science Applied to Electrical Energy Systems** at **Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya**, 

However, while the concepts and techniques introduced in the course were foundational, I must acknowledge that a large portion of my understanding and implementation was enhanced through additional learning, particularly from my brother, who has a deep understanding of these technologies. He helped me grasp key concepts, troubleshoot code, and explore advanced ideas that I incorporated into these project.

The algorithms and techniques used in this project were inspired by the teachings from the book *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow*, and the code examples presented in the book were used as a reference to build the machine learning models in this repository.
